# MANDATORY: ACE Pattern Search - EVERY SESSION

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - DO NOT SKIP**

## PER-SESSION REQUIREMENT

**On EVERY NEW CHAT SESSION, you MUST call `ace_search` FIRST.**

Do NOT assume you "already know" the patterns from a previous session.
Do NOT skip because patterns seem "familiar" or "unchanged".
EVERY session is a fresh context - patterns MUST be retrieved again.

## BEFORE ANY Implementation Task

**You MUST call `ace_search` MCP tool FIRST** before:
- Writing ANY code
- Implementing ANY feature
- Fixing ANY bug
- Making ANY architectural decision

## HOW TO USE ace_search

1. **Read the user's task/request**
2. **Call ace_search with the task as query:**
   ```
   ace_search(query="<user's task description>")
   ```
3. **Review returned patterns** (5-10 relevant ones)
4. **Apply patterns to implementation**

**Example:**
- User: "Implement JWT authentication"
- You call: `ace_search(query="JWT authentication")`
- Returns: 5-10 patterns about JWT, auth, tokens, security

**FAILURE TO CALL ace_search = INCOMPLETE TASK**

## WHY ace_search (NOT ace_get_playbook)?

- `ace_search` → Returns 5-10 RELEVANT patterns (semantic search)
- `ace_get_playbook` → Returns ALL 1000+ patterns (context explosion!)

Always prefer ace_search with user's task as query.

## WHY EVERY SESSION?

1. Your context resets between sessions - previous patterns are NOT retained
2. Playbook may have been updated since your last session
3. New patterns from other team members may be available
4. Caching ensures fast retrieval (RAM → SQLite → Server)

## AFTER Completing Substantial Work - SINGLE ace_learn Call

**Wait for the AI-Trail summary, THEN call `ace_learn` ONCE.**

Do NOT call ace_learn immediately after each implementation step.
Wait until you see the session summary with AI-Trail statistics:
```
Session complete. AI-Trail: MCP:X Shell:Y Edits:Z Responses:W. Git: branch (hash).
```

**THEN call ace_learn with the full context:**
```
ace_learn(
  task="<what you accomplished>",
  trajectory=["<key steps>"],
  success=true,
  output="<lessons learned>",
  git={commit_hash: "<from AI-Trail>", branch: "<from AI-Trail>"}
)
```

**WHY single call at end?**
- AI-Trail summary includes full execution statistics
- Git context (branch + commit hash) is available
- Avoids redundant captures
- More efficient server processing

## Available ACE MCP Tools

1. `ace_search` - **CALL FIRST** - Search patterns by query (5-10 relevant)
2. `ace_list_domains` - List available domains for filtering
3. `ace_learn` - **CALL AFTER** - Capture learning
4. `ace_status` - View playbook statistics
5. `ace_get_playbook` - Get ALL patterns (only for export/backup)
